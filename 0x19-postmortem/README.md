Postmortem: Web Application Outage
Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage: April 15, 2024, 10:30 AM - 12:15 PM (UTC)

Impact: Our web application experienced a slowdown during this period, leading to degraded user experience. Users reported significantly increased load times for the dashboard and could not access the API endpoints. Approximately 65% of users were affected, leading to numerous complaints and a spike in support tickets.

Root Cause: The outage was traced back to a sudden spike in database queries due to an unoptimized SQL query in the user analytics feature, which was exacerbated by a lack of caching mechanisms.

Timeline
10:30 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system flagged a 200% increase in response times for API calls.

10:35 AM: The engineering team received alerts from our monitoring system, indicating unusually high database load.

10:40 AM: The first investigation focused on the server metrics, assuming a server overload due to increased user traffic.

10:45 AM: Engineers checked the load balancer and server health, suspecting a potential DDoS attack due to the spike in response times.

11:00 AM: The team discovered that the database server was under heavy load, prompting a closer look at recent code changes.

11:15 AM: Upon reviewing recent updates, it was identified that a new analytics feature had been deployed, which included a complex SQL query fetching extensive user data without proper indexing.

11:30 AM: The issue was escalated to the Database Administration team for further investigation and resolution.

11:45 AM: The offending SQL query was optimized, and caching was implemented to reduce direct database hits.

12:15 PM: The application was restored to normal operation, with user response times returning to expected levels.

Root Cause and Resolution
The primary cause of the issue was an unoptimized SQL query triggered by the new user analytics feature. This query was fetching large volumes of data without appropriate indexing, causing a bottleneck in the database. Additionally, the absence of caching mechanisms meant that every user request was directly hitting the database, overwhelming its capacity.

To resolve the issue, the engineering team optimized the SQL query by adding the necessary indexes and rewriting it to reduce the amount of data retrieved. Furthermore, a caching layer was implemented to store frequently accessed data, significantly decreasing the load on the database during peak usage times.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes
Review Database Queries: Conduct a comprehensive review of all database queries for optimization opportunities.

Implement Caching: Establish a caching strategy for frequently accessed data to mitigate load on the database during high traffic.

Upgrade Monitoring Tools: Enhance monitoring tools to include real-time analytics on database performance and query execution times.

Task List
Optimize SQL Queries: Audit all current SQL queries to identify and optimize those with performance issues.

Implement Redis Cache: Set up Redis as a caching layer for user analytics and other frequently accessed data.

Establish Alerting on Query Performance: Configure alerts for slow-running queries to proactively address potential performance bottlenecks.

Conduct Load Testing: Perform load testing on the database and application to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify weaknesses.

Documentation Update: Update internal documentation to include best practices for writing efficient SQL queries.
